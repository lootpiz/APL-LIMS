### After data matching, a report must be generated, which has to be accessible from anywhere in the laboratory. Also, data needs to be moved to a long term storage. Based on this
 * _How do you deliver your reports?_
   * Clinical reports (i.e., ISO20428) will be generated automatically whether a clinically actionable mutation has been reported. Then, a system (i.e., LIMS) will notify clinicians and bioinformaticians to check the reports and they will visit the LIMS, where a secure login system is implemented.

 * _How do you know if the analysis passed QA/QC and then can be moved to the storage?_
   * Along with the clinical reports, diagnostic plots generated in QC process will be available on the same page on LIMS. The LIMS also provides a symbol in different colors (i.e., red or green) to show the statuses/results of the processing whether there was problematic data.

 * _Long term storage is in another network hub (not in the lab intranet) which is also protected by the same firewall. What would be your preferred method to transfer data? Would be manual or automated transfer?_
   * Once clinicians and bioinformaticians confirmed the clinical and other reports, raw and processed data can be automatically transferred to an archiving system that can be triggered by LIMS via Rsync.Â
