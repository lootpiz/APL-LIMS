### PCR runs are monthly, while NGS are weekly. PCR results provide ancillary data that will be compared to some variants obtained from sequencing, and the machine generates a simple CSV/TSV file with one column containing the sample ID and 10 more result columns. Thereâ€™s no way to automate data extraction from the PCR machine, and the data needs to be generated by a technologist on a desktop computer (connected to the network) and then transferred to another location.
 * _What do you suggest would be the best way to transfer the data from one point to another?_
   * Based on my experience, PCR machines export reports to a Windows machine. I would suggest creating a network shared storage (i.e., SAMBA) and attached a SAMBA storage to the technicians' Windows machine. The technician needs simply drag and drop result files in the network shared folder then update the APL-LIMS to trigger quality check processes. Lastly, the technician needs to confirm the files whether they are readable/writable in the new folder.   

 * _What do you suggest to minimize problems from the data being exported by the machine?_
   * When technicians upload PCR results, it would be ideal if they could upload metadata including the capacity of the files, timestamps, and the name of submitters to the APL-LIMS. And, sample names/IDs can be enumerated in the metadata file and the metadata file should be stored in the APL-LIMS.
